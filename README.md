# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

The R script, `run_analysis.R`, does the following:

1. Download the dataset 
2. Transform the data my merging test and train data sets
3. A tidy dataset is created with summary of the average (mean) value of each
   variable for each subject and activity pair.

The output is a file `tidy.txt`.
